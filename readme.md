This utility reads messages from gotify in real time and forwards them according to the configuration to other services. [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) is used for sending.

## Config

The configuration uses a yaml file. You can configure sending for individual applications registered in Gotify. Also, filtering by the minimum message priority is possible.

By default `/etc/gotify2apprise/config.yaml` used as config file. But its possible set custom path with `CONF_FILE` env variable

Example config:

```yaml
applications: #root of config, mus be array of
  - tokens:
    - all #if all presented we use this receivers for all messages
    receivers: # settings for receivers
      - urls:
        - mailto://myemail:mypass@gmail.com
        - pover://USER_KEY@TOKEN
    receivers:
      - urls:
        - tgram://MY_BOT_TOKEN
        minPriority: 4 #send message only for "warning" and greater
  - tokens:
    - GOTIFY_APP_TOKEN1 # receivers in this block process only
    - GOTIFY_APP_TOKEN2 # messages from this two apps
    receivers:
      - urls:
        - discord://WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN
        minPriority: info
      - urls:
        - slack://TokenA/TokenB/TokenC/
        priorities: #also you can determine specific list of priorities for your receiver
        - info
        - 9
        - 10
```

You can use any receiver for any application token in any combination. You can also send messages to Gotify via gotify://hostname/token url but be careful not to go sending in an infinite cycle.

For priorities settings you can use key words:

- info - if used in minPriority its equal 0. For priorities its translate to values 0, 1, 2 and 3
- warn - if used in minPriority its equal 4. For priorities its translate to values 4, 5, 6 and 7
- crit - if used in minPriority its equal 8. For priorities its translate to values 8, 9 and 10
